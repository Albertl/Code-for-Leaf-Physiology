This folder contains files output from 'import_and_format_clean_licor_files.m' for input 
into scripts for A-Cc curve and light curve fitting.  For Genetic algorithm A/Cc fitting,
use these as for input into Test_Environmental_Variable_Extraction_V1.m

Right now these files need to be copied over to use with genetic algorithm A/Cc fitting, 
but could write a script to move them over (or change directory of output).  For light
curve fitting with R, the working directory is this directory (no need to copy and move).
For Anet extraction (Extract_A_net_in_loop.R),  the working directory is this directory 
(no need to copy and move). For Domingues A/Cc curve fitting, the working directory is 
this directory (no need to copy and move).
