Code-for-Leaf-Physiology
========================

The goals for this code include:
(1) Automatically extract environmental variables for each ACI curve
(2) Run the batch analysis for extracting key physiological parameters

Script descriptions:
Test_Environmental_Variable_Extraction_V1.m
includes Part 1: automatically extract the environmental variables and Part 2: automatically extract physiological parameter

Environmental variable is saved as ./Env_Variables_Output/
Physiological variables is saved as ./Physiology_Output/
The internal model and observed A-CI plot is also saved as ./Physiology_Output/
